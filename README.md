# CRNN-TF

Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN): A combination of CNN, RNN and CTC loss for image-based sequence recognition tasks in TensorFlow.
<br/>The system utilizes pretrained Inception ResNet v2 backbone for feature extraction which are fed to the RNN with CTC loss for generating image transcriptions. The implementation is incomplete at this point.
